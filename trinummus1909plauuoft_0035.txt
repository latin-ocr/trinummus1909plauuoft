INTRODUCTION xxxi

(b) The mode of solution (233-236). Iambic-ana-
paestic period.

(2) The case against Amor.

(a) Amoris artes (237-241). Mixed meters, anapaests
prevailing.

(b) Amanus fatum (2410-254). Mixed meters, but
mainly cretics.

(3) Amor repudiated.

(α) Brief review of the situation 255-259). Ana-
paestic dimeters, closing with a versus
Rez‘zz'amcs.

(b) Final rejection of Amor (260-2750). Wholly
anapaestic.

B. Responsive verses (276-279). Four anapaestic dim-

eters.

C. The monody of Philto (280-300) falls into two parts:

(1) Warning against the bad (280-287). Mixed
meters, lai-gely cretic.

(2) Complaints about the manners of the day (288-
300). ΧἯιοΠγαῃᾶρειθεῇο.

Philto opens (280) with a verse, Which is conspicuous
in A (2), viz„ a cretic tetrameter catalecti03 282 and
284 are also cretio tetrameters3 281 is like 240 and 2473
285 is like 254. The period also contains three iambic
octonarii (283, 286, 287), corresponding to the iambic ele-
ments in the previous song. Thus the metrical forms of A
(2 and 3) are taken up and varied in O (1 and 2), so that
the two monodies are closely related throughout. This re-
lation is indicated even in the language used, for the two

anapaestic divisions, A (3) and Ο (2), begin respectively “

with the words, haec 690 quom “90 and haec eqo doleo.
