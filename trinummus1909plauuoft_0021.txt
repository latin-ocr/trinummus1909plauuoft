were developed, and these “ music-hall songs‚'' as they have
been called,¹ are apparently the immediate predecessor-s of
the distinctly lyrica] cantica of Plautus, in whose plays the
more reflective or emotional passages, especially those in
soliloquy form, are presented iu a variety of metm-⁸:2² The
labored style, which often characterizes these in contrast
with the easy flow of the dialogue, is probably due to the
difficulty of adaptiug the thought to the Greek form. Ter-
ence, after one experiment, wisely abandoned the more
elaborate lyrical measures.3

9. The dialogue of Plautus is rich, full, and spontaneous
in its diction, proving the author to be a perfect master of
the art of expression. The grammar-iaus and critics of the
republican period, who were in a much better position than
their successors of imperial times to appreciate the difficul-
ties, in respect of language, which confi-onted the early
writers, speak of the style of Plautus in eulogistic tei-ms.
Cicero compares it with that of the best Greek poets, in
exhibiting iocandi 9621ch clessam, urbanum, ῖηῃθηίοιςιιηῑ, face—
tum& and Aelius Stilo, whose opinion used to be quoted by
his pupil, the learned Varro, is said to have declared that
this would have been the style followed by the Muses them-
selves, had they spoken in Latin.⁵

10. As to the dramatic art of Plautus, we have already
seen that Horace’s judgment was distinctly unfavorable.
He accuses him of being careless and slipshod,
