INTRODUCTmN xxix

43. Of [ambio lines, senarii are suitable for narrative and
expositi0n3 septenarii and octonarii are used in peculiarly
emphatic statements and injunctions (cf. 233—234, 283). Of
the trochaic measures, the septenarii are more animated than
the iamhic senarii (cf. Introd, ἐξ 32, 36). Octonarii are
more impassioned. The only example in the Trimcmmus
251) succeeds a series of cretics and is very ironical.

Anapaests, which in Greek are a marching measure, are
used freely in Plautus in lyrica] passages. At 820 ff. Char-
mides returns thanks to the gods for his preservation in
anapaestic tetrameters, which change to dimeters, as the
sycophanta is seen approaching. Of the remaining lyrical
measures, cretz‘es are often employed to express irony, indig-
nation, 01· veheinence (cf. 243, 244, 282, 284). Bacchides
are used at the opening of the canticum, 223 ff, where the
speaker is in great perturbatior] of mind.
