xxii INTRODUCTION

Similar is the case with the borrowed words sayitta (729 9)
and satellztes (833), 111 which the shortened second syllable
is due to the influence of ι1000111.

24. Accented monosyllables, ending in a long vowel or
a diphthong, are merely shortened before a following short
vowel or h, cf. qu? homo (305), ont> eius (430), εἴ eris (677),
τὲ honestet (693). So, too, accented monosyllables ending in
‘m are not elided; cf. rem ((901 (842), mim 090 (25). The
shortening of 0 111 such a compound as introierit (10) is
similar. This is called semi-hiatus.

25. HIATUS. — Aside from the cases just given, hiatus is
very common in Plautus. It occurs
(1) after interjections,

(2) where there is a change of speakers,

(3) where there is a distinct elocutionary pause in the
midst of a speech3

(4) in the middle of a long verse, which is thus treated
as if made up of two independent verses3

(5) in certain cases which cannot well be classified. In
some of these the text is probably corrupt.

26. SYNIZESIS, the settlz'ny together, or blending, of adja-
cent vowels of a word into one, is very frequent in Plautus,
a short vowel being regularly subordinated to a following
long, as in many pronominal forms, cf. meo (81), tuae (117),

tui (46), tuis (302), ei (14,119), eorum (33), eosdem (295),
quoius (501), hams (795). Similarly, rei (119), deum (346,

355), dies (581), <luorum (626), 17707'7zde (65), diutius (685),
clzerecte (457).1

1 In synizesis a dissyllable becomes a quasi-monosyllable, but the char-
acter of the first vowel is not wholly lost or changed into a consonantal
one. Thus the Virgilian abiete (= abyete) is not, strictly speaking, an in—
stance of synizesis. For an elaborate discussion of the subject, see Radforo‘t,
Trans. of Amer. Phil. Assoc„ vol. 36 (1905), p. 158.
