6. Vfflzsus Rmzmxns ¹

41. This composite verse consists usually of the iambic
dimeter followed by an unbroken rhythmical phrase. This
phrase is known as the Colon Reizianum, and exhibits a
great variety of forins, coinprising five, six, or seven sylla-
bles. The instances in the Trinummm, to which may be
added 240, 247, 281, referred to in the next paragraph, are
the following (the Colon Reizianum alone being scanned) : ² —-

t. Anomo DIPODY

42. The Adonic Dipody (Lu υ lL υ), familiar to us
from the Sapphic Stanza of Horace, is used in combination
with other rhythins. Plautus resolves the long syllable into
two short ones. In the Τ νὶηῑωηῃῑ us this clausula is used with
Cretic Diineters (248, 250) and also with Iambic Dimeters,
instead of the Colon Reizianum (240, 247, 281).

1 So named from Reiz, a scholar who lived early in the nineteenth century.
On this verse, see Klotz, Grundzic'sse Aleriimischer Metrik, pp. 517 ff.; Lind-
say, Introd. to Οαῃΐίυἰ, p. 99.- Lane’s Latin ernmar, p. 462.

2 As the Colon is of quite indeterminate character, no ictus is marked.
