METER

27. In one respect a Latin comedy resembled a modern
opera. A large proportion of each play was either sung or
recited to a musical accompaniment. Scenes which were
merely spoken and involved no musical clement were known
as diverbia. These were the soenes composed in iambic
senarii.

28. Scenes into which a musical clement entered were of
two kinds. They were either (a) declaimed in recitative
style, with flute accompaniment, or (b) they were actually
sung to set tunes. Both of these kinds of scenes were
known as cantica. The former (a) were composed either in
trochaic septenarii, iambic septenarii, or iarnbic octonarii.
The latter (b) were distinctly lyrical scenes, composed in a
variety of meters, including not only the 111016 unusual
01163, but also those mentioned in connection with (a), the
merely recited cantica.

29. The iainbic (υ -) and trochaic ζ.. υ), 33 well as
anapaestic (υ υ-), meters of Roman eomedy take their
strict Latin names —e.9. senso-sus, septenarius, octonarius—-
from the number of individual feet which each line contains.
In Greek poetry, however, these measures are based upon
units of dipodies, or combinations of two feet, whence a line
of four feet is known as a dimeter, one of six feet as a tri-
meter, and so on. In an iainbic dipody (υ -. υ -) the
Greeks allowed the substitution of a spondee (- -) 01 a
dactyl (- ψ υ) for an iambus only in the first half, just 33
111 3 trochaic dipody (- υ - ψ) the corresponding substitu-
tions of spondee and anapaest (υ υ -) were allowed only in
the second half. The disi-egard of this rule, or the los's of
distinction between odd and even feet, constitutes the main
metrica] difference between Latin and Greek comedy. In
