7. The personal and politica] abuse, which in the Old
Coinedy naturally accompanies its grossness, we need not
expth to find in Plautus. The apparent absence of strong
convictions 111 politics or anything else 011 the author’s part
sufficiently accounts for this3 but even if it had been other-
wise, the fate of the poet Naevius,2 who was iniprisoned for
his boldness of speech, would probably have deterred the
younger contemporary froin following in his footsteps. Plau-
tus, however, may show the direcb influence of Old Comedy
in his occasional allusions to current events, in the frequent

asides addi-essed 'co the audience, and especially in the petra-

2 bas-{8³ which marks 'che Curculio.

8. It is claimed by Sellar4 that “ 111 the large place as-
j signed to the Cantica? which were acconipanied hy music
and gesticulation,⁷⁷ the Plautine plays show considerable
‘ti‘aces of the indigenous Saturae.ss Doub‘cless these exer-ted
some influence, but it is highly probable that the cantica are
the snrviving sorni of the old choral songs, which embodied
the original lyr-ic elemen‘c 111 Greek comedy. With the loss
of the 61101118, this element, instead of being concentra‘ced
as before, became more or less scattered through the dia-

Aristophanes (444-338 Bw.) belongs mainly to Old Cmnedy, but also to
Middle Comedy (lul-:3:3⁴3 1;.(’.). For New Comedy, see note 1 on p. xiv.

3 In the par-abusis os a Greek play, the chorus leader‚ addressing the
audience in the name of the poet, sets forth his views 011 literary questions
or 011 matters of public interest.

6 The Saturae were a form of popular dramatic entertainment‚ consist-
ing of responsive and jocular verses, accompanied by the flute and a pan-
tolnimic dance. After the establishment of regular plays, the dramatic
saturae continued to be employed as farces or after-plays (cocotha).
