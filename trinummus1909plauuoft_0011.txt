PREFAOE

Tm: present edition of the Trinummus, one of the most
popular of Latin plays, as well as one of the best for college
use, has been prepared in accordance with the general plan
of this Series. It ainis at giving such help as will be needed
by the young student when he first grapples with a Latin
comedy. At the same time, great care has been taken to
introduce no reading or interpretation which is not in har-
mony with the best Plautine scholarship of to—day.

In preparing the book, I have consulted most of the great
editors of Plautus, but I ani under special obligations to
Leo and Lindsay‚ with whose texts this will be found to be
in substantia] agreement. All important differences between
Leo and Lindsay, as well as my few variations from them,
are recorded in the Appendix.

I beg to acknowledge my indebtedness to Messrs. Allyn
and Bacon for kind permission to reproduce substantia]
portions of the Introduction to my edition of the Andria of
Terence, published by them in 1901.
