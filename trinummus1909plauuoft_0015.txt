INTRODUCTION

LIFE AND WORK OF PLAUTUS

1. Of the life of Τ. Maccius Plautus very little is known.
Cicero (De Senectute, 50) states that he was an old man in
191 Β.0., when the Pseudolus was performed, and he died in
184 Β.0.

2. Τ116 poet was born at Sarsina, in Umbria, probably
about 254 B.o. Going 111 early life to Rome, he is said to
have worked 111 some connection with the stage and then to
have invested his savings in foreign trade. Returning
penniless to Rome, he was employed as a laborer in a 111111,
but found time to write plays, which won for hixn both
fame and profit.l

3. All the works of Plautus are palliatae (sc. fabulae), 2'.e.
plays adapted from the Greek, so called because of the
Greek cloak (pallium) worn by the aet01·s.2 Out of one hun-
dred and thirty plays once assigned to Plautus, the learned
Varro³ gave twenty-one as belonging to Plautus consensu
omnium, and nineteen more as probably genuine. These
twenty-one, the so—called fabulae Vcwrouianae, are in all
probability the twenty which have come down to us, to-
gether with the Vidularia, which was lost in the Middle

1 These bare facts are elaborated by Sellar‚ Roman Poets of the Repub-
lic‚ pp. 158 ff.
2With the palliatae are contrasted toyataffi in Which the soenes and
personages were Roman. These were later known as tabernariae (from
taberna, a shop) because of their vulgar 10116.
8 Lived 116-27 B.c. He wrote De Linyua Latina and Res Raeticae.
