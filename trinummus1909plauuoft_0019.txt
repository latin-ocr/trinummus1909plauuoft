popular entertainments as to the sordid motive which
the critic imputes to Plautus —

Gestit enim nummum in loculos demittere.

The verb percurrere, which Horace applies in such a depre-
ciative way to Plautus, is curiously similar in meaning to
another, properare, used in a line where the context shows
that the characteristic referred to meets with approval.
Here, in his rapidity of niovement (the precise force is
doubtful), Plautus is said to have taken Epicharmus ¹ as a
model. There is no reason to doubt this statement, but we
may also bear in mind that Epicharmus, with all his refine-
ment, was the representative of a dramatic field—Sicilian
comedy--which was “essentially bu1-1esque,’⁷2 being the
direct outgrowth of the rude Doric farces.3 If we are
correct in assuming the presence of a large native clement
in the comedy of Plautus, it would be but natural that his
plays, quite apart from any conscious imitation, should
resemble the comedies of Epicharmus.

indecorous demeanor, and apparent disregard of common
morality which many of his plays exhibit—is best ex-
plained by the merry abanclon and unrestrained spirit of
frolic which characterized the rustic festivals of the Ro·
mans, and which may be compared with the Dionysiae
revels, in which Greek comedy had its origin.4 It is these
revels which account for much that is offensive to modern

the first to introduce the drunkard and the parasite as dramatic types.

appeared certain stock characters, not unlike those in the Atellanae.
