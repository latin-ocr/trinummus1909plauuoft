116 APPENDIX

857. hac: thus Lindsay, after A. The common reading is hoc.

878. For hosce, Leo reads hisce.

888. uixillum: Lindsay reads uexillum, for which the form
uixillum appears in certain inscriptions. In this case, uexillum
could be rendered “a lable‚’' uinarium being an adjective.

901. Leo rejects this verse, regarding it as inserted in some
acting editiony so as to allow the omission of vv. 928—949.

922. num Charmides? Leo reads enim Charmides, making the
sycophant's reply begin with this remark. He also gives the
words disci 690 iam dudum tibi to the sycophant, and assumes a
lacuna before 924.

935. ac: the Mss. give atque, which Leo retains, taking it as a
monosyllable. For the obJ‘ection to scanning atque cu- as an
anapaest‚ see Brix.

946-948. Thus Leo, who is responsible for filling up the gaps
in 946 and 947.

977. For recharmida, Ritschl thought it necessary to substitute
decharmz'da and Brix echarmida. More recent editors (including
Goctz-Schoell) retain the reading of the Mss.

1018. For quia, Miiller proposes quinque (Rhcz'n. Mus. 54, 540).

1020. On these names, see Schmidt, Herm. 37, 362.

1036. strenuosos: Lindsay adopts Loewe’s correction of the
Mss. strenuos. Leo prefers strenuiores.

1112-1114. So Ritschl. The Mss. show the verses as fol-

lows: —
Quamquam labores multos

Sed hic unus, ut ego suspicor, servat fidem.
Ob rem laborem eum ego cepisse censeO.

1123. quantum potest: supplied by Leo. Lindsay reads Εο. Sed
fores, making hae sonitu begin 1124, but this order would be un-
usual. See Preseott, Thouqht and V erse in Plautus, in Univ. Calis.
Publ. Class. Phil. Vol. I, p. 253.

1130-1131. Leo rejects these two verses. Lindsay reads uelit
for uelis.

1183. huius: due to Hermann. Accepted by Leo. Wacker-
nagel would read Callicle& (Archiv Lat. Lex. 14. 5.)

1188. optumumst: the Mss. give optumumst licet. Lindsay
retains the former word; Leo, the latter.
