now.

1139. pergraphicus: ahybrid formation; cf. note on 9raphice‚767.

1140. meo datu: verbal nouns in -tus are more common in early
than in later Latin; so meo adleyatu, 1142. Cicero uses arbitratu
meo (De Amicitia, 1. 3).

1146. populi patrium posceret: marked alliteration. Note the
double accusative with posco.

1148. quin: noy. The word seems to imply that Callicles sus-'
pects Charmides of disapproving of the plati—conlaudo: cf.
note on 26.

1153. salutis dignus: the genitive with diynus is like ’chat with
ἄξιος in Greek. It occurs in inscriptions and in a letter of
Balbus quoted by Cicero (od Atticum, VIII. 15 Α 1), suscipe
curam et coyitatz'onem dionissz‘mam tuae uirtutis.

1154. tunica propior palliost: the best English equivalent, is the
Manx saying: “ Near is my sark, but nearer is my skin,'' cited by
Hall s'aine in his novels. With these may be compared Theoc-
ritus. 16, 18, ἀπωτέρω ἢ ’γόνυ κνάμα, “the knee iS nearer than the
shin.’⁷

1155. deos: a monosyllable.

1156. neuis: cf. 328.

1158. mille auri Philippum dotis: here auri (= aureus) is a geni-
tive of material with Philippum, and dotis is an appositional
genitive. With ouri Philippum, cf. the French louis d'or, and for
Philippum, see Introduction, ᾗ 23.

1159. placenda: must please. This use of a gerundive from an
intransitive verb, with active meaning, is peculiar; cf. abstandus,
264.

1160. feres: take.
