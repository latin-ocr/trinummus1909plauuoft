92 NOTES

703. mea opera: thanks to me. — autument: men would say,-
ie. si hoc facias. For autumo, cf. 324.

704. commissurum ut patiar fieri: unusual fullness of expres-
sion, and therefore emphatic; ut potiar depends on commissurum
(esse). —ne animum induxeris: don’t imaqine.

705. enim: indeed. This affirmative force, so common in
Plautus, is preserved in the cornbinations sed enim, at enim. ete. —
euge: bravo! (Greek εὖγε). — πάλαις encore! See notes on
187, 419.

706. hic uictust, eto: this reference to dramatic contests is
undoubtedly taken from the Greek original.

707. ex argumento: literally, ‘⁴ in accord wit-h the plot,’⁷ ie.

is very characteristic of Plautus. ⁴

710. eodem pacto: ile. pedibus, a saucy auswer.

715. bene quod agas, ete: ile. you will have my good wishes,
but I can promise nothing more.

716. sic sententia est: sor sic in the predicate with esse, cf.
ita es ut, 46, with note.

717. ecquid audis: a word with yon! The question has impera—
tival force: cf. quid ctis ,² 1923.— ego te uolo: see note on 516.

720. fulmentas: heels. The soccus, or slipper of the comio
stage, had no heels, unlike the cothurnus, or buskin, of tragedy. —
non sisti potest: it cannot be stopped, oi· helped ,· impersonal use.

72].. caculam militarem: α soldier’s (frutice—haud longius:
