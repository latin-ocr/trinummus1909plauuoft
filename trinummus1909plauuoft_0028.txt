xxiv INTRODUCTION

Plautus, substitutions and resolutions are, with certain ex-
ceptions, allowed in any foot.

30. In reading verse, a metrical stress (ictus metricus) is
naturally laid upon particular syllables, in order to make the
rhythin perceptible to the ear. 111 iainbic and trochaic verse,
this stress falls upon the long syllable of each foot, or upon
the first of two short ones substituted for it. Since the time
vof Bentley, it has been customary for editors to assist the
reader by marking the ictus, but only in the alternate feet
in those lneters which the Greeks measured by dipodies.
We should, however, recognize an ictus in each foot.

31. For the iambus, ψ L, any of the following feetmay
be substituted 1; (α) tribrach, υ ό ψ; (b) spondee, -L3
(c) anapaest, υ ψ L, ((1) dactyl, - <a υς (e) proceleusmatic,
ψ ψ <s υ. In an acatalectic verse, however, the final foot
must be a pure iambus, or pyrrhic (υ υ), the last syllable,
of course, being indifferent (syllaba cmceps).2 The trochee
(ἡ υ) ewa neret· be substitutedsor the iambus.

32. IAMssIo SENARIUS (Trimeter Acatalectzssc). —This is
one of the connnonest meters in Plautus. Most of the plays
open with it, and in the Trin ammas it is used in 535 verses, —-
forty-five per cent of the whole. The verse admits caesura,
usually the pentheniimeral, before the long syllable or its
equivalent 111 the third foot3 less commonly the hephthe-

iambus (υ -,) represents three shortS, while the feet in question represent

four.

2 Syllaba anceps is also allowed within the verse, both in iambic and
other metrica] systems, (α) at any marked pause, as when there is achange
of speaker; cf. 5S5; (b) at the diaeresis; cf. 837 (anapaestic).
