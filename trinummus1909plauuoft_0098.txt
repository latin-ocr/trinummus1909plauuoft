58 NOTES

3. em: see! — nunciam: a trisyllable. This redundant ex-
pression is used by Livy (7. 32. 14), while iam nunc, iam iam are
Ciceronian as well.

4. ne quis erret uostrum: ὑεῖ. lest you suppose us to be charac-
ters in the play itself ; nostrum = uestrum. —paucisz sc. uerbis. —
in uiam: into the riqht way,· corresponding to erret, lose one's way.

5. operam dare: to ysne attention. Note the omission of the
subject accusative. The use of the infinitive present for the future
is frequent in comedy, especially with darc and aster promittere.
A Roman audience was apparently very noisy during the reeital
of the prologue.

6. quae ego: semi-hiatus. Introduction, ᾗ 24. — illaec: she,-
2'.c. Inopia. — siet z sit ; the form is really an old optative, siem
.-- εἵην (*ε’σίην).

8. Plautus: Terence never speaks of himself thus by name, but
uses the word poetar. — Luxuriae: dative.

9. tum Ι hanc: on hiatus, see Introduction, §25

10. introierit: Introduction, ξ 24.

11. uoeiuas -- uacuas, which is the later form.

12. hisce: this form, as well as hosce, hasce, stands in Plautus
mainly before a vowel or h, but his, hos, has, only before consonants.

14. quoniam: now that (quom icon), the original temporal force .

being partially retained. —— ei: a monosyllable. Introduction,
ἑ 26. — qui me aleret: wlie‘rewith to maintain me. In early Latin,
qui is a common instrumenta} (or perhaps locative) form of the
relative, interrogative, or indefinite pronoun. Hence a variety
of uses. Here, qni z quo. The imperfect tense is used in aleret,
probably because esse relicui is the same as esse relictum, which
would allow second-ary sequence, but in colloquial Latin there is
much frecdom in the sequence of tenses—relicui: partitive
genitive, with nil. The word has four syllables in the older
literature, being later reliquus.

15. quicum z quacum.

16. sed: the statement already given would lead the hearer to
expect an outline of the plot.

17. i: ei, nom. pl. (never iz· in Plautus). ,

18. Thensauro: cf. note on Aryumentum, 1. For the case, cf.
Luxuriae, S. ’
