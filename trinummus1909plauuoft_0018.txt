xiv INTRODUCTION

5. But assuming that Terence, dimidiatus Menander)
mirrors most faithfully the tone and ensemble effect of the
N ew Attio Comedy, we cannot suppose, in view of the great
difference which the most superficial reader must detect be-
tween him and Plautus, that the earlier writer strictly con-
fined himself to any one field. We must, indeed, believe
that in the Plautine plays the author made use of all the
dramatic resources within his reach. His literary activity
began toward the end of the Second Punic XVar, and it was
shortly after 211 Bc. that the Atellanae² were introduced
into Rome. It is highly probable that these popular per-
formances suggested to Plautus much of the broad farce
and audacious roguery which fill his plays. Horace, who
was no admirer of Plautus, calls him a very Dossennus,

Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis (Epist. 2. 1. 173)

and the nomen itself of the author is by some derived from
another stock character in the Atellan farce, viz.: Maccus,
the buffoon. The careless haste to which Horace refers in
the same passage —-

Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco

is probably due quite as much to the influence of inartistic

1 Terence is so styled by Julius Caesar, in an epigram which begins: —-

Tu quoque tu in summis, Ο dimidiate Menander,
Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator.

Menander was the chief representative of the New Attio Comedy, which
flourished from about 336 ΒΕ. (the date of the accession of Alexander the
Great) to 250 B.c. We possess only fragments of his work, but recent
discoveries in Egypt have made very substantial additions to these.

2 Thefabulae Atellanae received their name froin Atella, an Oscan town
in Campania. The Atellan farce set forth in burlesque the life of villages,
and at an early time the characters followed fix'ed types. Maccus, for ex-
ample, is a simpleton or buffoon ς Bucco, a chattering fool; Pappus, avain
old man ς and Dossennus, a sly villain. Though the plots were pre-
arranged, the dialogue was largely improvised.
