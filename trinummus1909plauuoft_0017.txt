INTRODUCTmN xiii

4. These plays show a great variety in subject-matter,
characters, tone of thought, and construction of plot, due to
the natural versatility of the author and the extreme free-
dom with which he handled his models. These he abriclged
01· extended as he pleased, and though his characters and the
soenes which form the background of his plays are all Greek, ·
yet he has introduced such a large Roman clement that the
Latin comedies are evidently cast 111 a very different mould
from his Greek originals. The very titles of his plays are
mainly Latin, and from Latin are taken the names of cer-
tain of his characters, ey. the parasites Saturio, Peniculus,
and Curculio. His personages are familiar with Rome and
Italy 3 we find allusions to Roman customs, laws, institutions‚
officials, games, colonies, and contemporary history. His
⁷ language, too, shows much independence of his originals. It
abounds in distinctly Roman metaphors and similes, in plays
on words, striking alliterations, assonanees, and other pecul-
iarly icliomatic expressions, such as cannot be the result of
translation, but must belong to Plautus alone.1 Plautus,-
with his fluent style, his wealth of words, and natural ease
of expression, has left 115 the greatest storehouse of Latin
popular speech, the sermo wolfleo-is, as contrasted with the
more artificial literary style, or sermo urbanus. At the same
time Plautus delights in reproducing some of the idiomatic
features which he finds in the lang-uage of his originals. He
imports bodily Greek words and phrases,² and almost out-
does Aristophanes in coining extravagant patronymics and
other derivatives, as well as grotesque mouth—filling com-
pounds3 to which the Greek readily lends itself.
