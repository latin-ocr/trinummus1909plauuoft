APPENDIX

The extant Mss. of Plautus are of two fainilies. The only
representative of one is the Codex Ambrosianus, known as A, of
the fourth century A.D., written in Capitals.l The other Mss.
belong to the Palatine family, which is known collectively as P,
and are written in minuscule script. The oldest belongs to the
end of the tenth century.

In the following notes, we have cited all important variations
between the editions of Leo (1896) and Lindsay (1903), as well as
the few cases where this edition aecords with neither.

31—33. Thus Mss. Leo follows Bueheler in transposing 32 and 33.

51. tua aqit: Leo with A. Lindsay prefers ayit tua, with P.

72-74. Leo rejects not only 7⁶2a (not given by A), but also 73
and 74, partly because of the use of mores, and partly because these
verses intcrrupt the simile in aeqrotant and morbum.

85. quod: so Mss. Leo reads qai after Scaliger.

96. Thus Lindsay, aecepting the corrections of Reiz and Bothe.

103. dici discrucior: this correction by Ritschl of the dicis
excrucior of the Mss. is accepted by Leo,

168. inscribit: Leo reads inscripsit after Nonius.

185. Skutsch proposes eme meam, etc., eme being (presumably)
the original form of em (th'loloyus, 59, 500).

186. So Lindsay, adhering to A. Leo reads: hascine propter
res maledicas famas serant.

192. fit: Leo adheres to fiet (A).

223-300. Leo’s arrangement of this canticam is followed in this
edition. For a discussion of it, see Leo's Die plautinischen Cantica
und die hellen z'stz'sche Lyrilc (Berlin, 1897).

238 a. Lindsay adheres to A, reading eos petit, eos sectatur.

239. Lindsay retains subdole blanditur.

¹Studemund’s famous apograph of this Ms. has been consulted
throughout by the editor.
