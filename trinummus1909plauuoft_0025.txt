INTRODUCTmN xxi

ῑῖῖέ, ηῦηψῦ ,· cf. 137, 6723 328, 427. The probable explana-
, tion is that, the words being atonic, their first syllable is
only ‘half-long) Other words similarly treated by Plautus
are iste, inde, uncle (218), quippe. Another theory1 is that
the final e could be disregarded3 cf. nec and neque, neec and
nere ; also teme) concilies (386).

20. Quantitative weakening² is seen also in &equis (83⁷0)5
quidquid (218), nescidquid (623), and in word-combinations
with the enclitic quidem, eg. dz‘tmquz‘clem (58), (Juanddqnidem
(352), and liicqm'dem (876). These words may be 00111-
pared with the Classical hodie (= 11ῦο die) and (semsi (= (stuwi
si).

21. es, from snm, is always long in Plautus,3 and the first
syllable of fieri, fierem, etc, at the end of iambic and trochaic
verses is long. .›

22·.„.Thss pronoun (not the adverb) Ιιίο 13 short. Similar.;
are istic and villle as nominatives. The adjective proprius!
retains its original long z· in 1130.

23. In words derived from the Greek, ch (= χ) may
make position in Plautus. Thus the first syllable is long in
Achilles and Acheruns (cf. 525). The word Philippus, as
the name of a coin, accents the first syllable (as 111 the
Greek) and has the second syllable short, 09. at 152, 1158.

1 The syncope theory, upheld by Skutsch, Liudsay, and others, is ably
combated by Radford in articles on “The Prosody of Ille‚'' iu Aoum-..Ioum
os Phil„ vols. 27 and 28 (1906 and 1907).

2 In anapaestie verse we have apparent scansions like qratia*- (821),
οἰίὄ (838), and yaucliis (1116, 11111). These scansions, if correct (they are
so taken by Lindsay (Introd. to Captivi, p. 37)), are due to the mere dis-
tance of the syllable from the acceut, but it is more likely that they are
cases of a kind of synizesis (aratia-s ε yratyas) 01· of complete suppression
ofz' (cf. evenat (41) for eveniat). In any case, the words turbidos (299) aud
turbines (835) like vivito (297) and divites (829), have the metrica] value
of anapaests. See ξ 38.
