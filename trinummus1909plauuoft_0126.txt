between impetrant· abiret (“ he should have gone ’') and impetraui
ut abz‘ret.—Di nostram fidem: Heaven help us! Donatus (on
Terence, Andria, 716) explains the words as admirantis adverbium
cum. exclamatione. It is hardly necessary to supply imploro or
obsecro.

592. re gesta, eto: all’s well that ends well! With 9estam,
supply rem, an accusative of exclamation.

593. etsi: alchouyh.

594. quid ea re fuat: what's to become of it all,· cf. si quid eo
fuerit, 157, with note. For suat, cf.saas. 268.

course, the continent as a whole, So in later times the Roman
province of Asia did not include more than a small portion of even
Asia Minor.

600. huc: see 577.

601. exturbauit: has routed out. ——hie: ie Callicles. The pause
