NOTES

ARGUMENTUM

This acrostie aryumsentum (statement of plot), like similar
productions in other plays, was probably composed early in the
imperial period. It is not the work of Plautus.

1. thensaurum: archaic form sor thesaurum (from θησαυρός),
treasure. —- abstrusum l abiens: the hiatus is probably an affected
archaism, in imitation of similar cases in the Plautine plays.

4. et z etiam ; not a Plautine use.

5. poscitur: sc. in matrimonium.

6. minus quo eum inuidia, ete: that without odium Callicles
may yive her a dowry‚· minus quo is used for quo minore (inuidia).
For the scansion of minas, see Introduction, ᾗ 16.

’7. mandat qui dicat: he commissions one to say‚· sc. eum.

8. ut uenit: i.e. the inessenger.

9. ut rediit: zle. Charmides. — quoius nubunt liberi: his chil-
dren wed. The liberi are the son and daughter of Charmides.
For the plot, see Introduction, ᾗ 46.

PROLOGUE

The prologues to the plays of Plautus are, for the most part,
spurious, having been composed at a time when the old plays
were revived for the stage. The prologue to the Trinummus,
however, is skillfully designed and may well be genuine. It is
the only one in which two speakers appear.

1. hac: this way.—gnata=nata; this archaic form is used
even by Virgil.—munus fungaris: sunyor always takes the ae-
cusative in Plautus. So too abutor, but utor and fruor take the ab·
lative; potior takes accusative, ablative, or genitive; vescor does
not occur in Plautus.

2. finem: i.e. of our journey. —- quem dicam: indirect question.
