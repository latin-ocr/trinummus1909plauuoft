xviii INTRODUCTION

and it would be easy to bring forward evidence in support
of this criticism. At the same time, he is one of the world's
greatest humorists‚ wh0, besides being immensely popular in
his own day, has exerted a powerful influence on the litera-
ture of modern times. A noble tribute to his genius is the
epitaph, in dactylic hexameters, cited by Gellius :¹ —

Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, Comoedia luget,
Scaena est deserta ac dein Risus, Ludus Iocusque,
Et numeri innumeri simul omnes conlacrumarunt.

PROSODY

11. The student should bear in mind that Virgil and the
rest of the Augustan poets had certain standards of lit—
erary form, which were largely divorced from the popular
speech, whereas Plautus and Terence modeled their lan-
. guage mainly upon the speech of everyday life. ln this sermo
> cottidianus we have to reckon with the influence of word
accent, as contrasted with quantity, to a much greater
extent than in Virgilian verse.

12. Thus word accent and verse ictus ² largely coincide in
Plautus and Terence and seldom clash, as in Virgil, in the
important words of a verse. The metrical stress‚ in fact,
commonly indicates the ordinary accentuation of words in
everyday speech3 eq. ccistiqcire (23), cdmlucibz‘le (25), sac-
creue‘re (31), cdmmute'mns (59), etc. Further, the accent of
a word in a sentence may be different from that which it
bears when standing by itself. Thus the subordinate words
in a sentence may unite with the more important ones to
form word groups, which then follow the ordinary rules of

soret, nisi α M. Varrone positum essct in libr-0 de poetis primo. Bahrens,
