XX INTRODUCTION

The shortened long may be (α) a monosyllable, (b) the long

’ syllable of an iambio word, (c) the first syllable of a dis-

syllabio or polysyllabio word, (cl) the second syllable of a
polysyllable. The following are examples from the Tri-
η um m nx .· —

(α) musei) ἷη manu. (104); quud dcl ventrem (482);

(b) ἔηΐηι ΐιι (61) ; cciv& (513); patet· malta (361);

’ (e) tami) {staec (T7); (Qum) &turbasti (137); qnod &ebibit
<mm

((1) (Zbclistz'ne (129); sbtzbeteitz‘ (398) ; tabbrndeulo (726).

15. Other peculiarities of early Latin versification are
ν the following:—

16. Final 8 after a short vowel was weakly sounded and
therefore such an s, followed by a consonant, usually fails
to make positi0n3 effipre'z‘cs quam (198), reusque (234), mccgfis
lubet (275). ’

17. Contrary to the later rule, a syllable ending in a
short vowel before a mute, followed by Z or r, is not ‘ eom-
mon,⁷ but relnains short3 (3.9. (tyro (616).

18. Certain final syllables, which became short in later
times, still retain in Plautus the original long quantity.
Thus : —

(α) -ᾶῐ, -ῡΐ, -ῖΐ, 111 many verb forms, as (Zz'cctt, (licebat, dicet,
(liris, (Ii.z·eric¹,· eg. «9th (842), Ῐιαῦἒΰ (206).

(b) -ᾶν and -ὀν 111 verbal forms, as dicar, dicon· and -ῥν and
-ὀν 111 substantives and comparative adjectives, as
mater, orator, l01192'62·‚· of. exercit& (226).

(c) oceasional cases like eris (971) are due to syllaba anceps
at a pause in the verse.

(cl) esso as Well as eq& is found in Plautus3 of. 173, 282.

19. Even in places where the iambie law does not apply,
the words ille and nempe often show the apparent scansion

1 But not ((3.9.) dicit, or futures in -ἱί, as erit, amabit.
